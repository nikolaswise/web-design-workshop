This is my friend's site and the first thing you see tells just about everything you would want someone to see off a first impression. His skills and name are listed. There is a video so you see exactly what he looks like and the video is short enough to want to click on. Just about everything you want to see is on the landing page as you scroll down. You don't have to click almost anywhere else to get anymore vital information.

This has much more of a hipster vibe, but I appreciate its simplicity. Clear hyperlinks to all the vital information. Great color design and it gives a clear message. Enough to want to find out a little more.
