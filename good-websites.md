# These Websites are Good
To find an example of good design, I thought I would look at a local web design company website. http://www.instrument.com/
Their website is enjoyable to interact with, it is simple (i.e lots of open space that makes it easy for your eye to know where to rest) and easy to understand what your next steps should be. Information is given slowly and in clear stages.
