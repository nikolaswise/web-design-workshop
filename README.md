## Overview
=======
# jekyll-reveal

A [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) template for quickly writing slides in markdown. Based on [mdo](https://github.com/mdo)'s [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) theme and [hakimel](https://github.com/hakimel)'s [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js) HTML presentation framework.

This is a *very* preliminary experimental release. Please pardon the mess.

<<<<<<< HEAD
In the course of this workshop, we will be introducing and discussing both the technical structures of web design as well as the independent disciplines within the field. You will be learning the basics of creating web sites, starting from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Alongside the basics, you will produce a project that combines your journalistic process with one of the disciplines of web design. The final day of class will be a discussion of these projects, demonstrating a firm grasp of how to communicate in a web-driven design discussion.

Graduate students will be expected to engage in a more rigorous final project, and will produce more work in assignments as described in the [schedule](#schedule)

## Outcomes

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- Competently engage in web design discussions.
- Understand and use the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS.
- Engage in industry standard workflows involving Github and Markdown.

## Office Hours

Office hours can be scheduled on an individual bases as needed.

## Policies

### Grading

All projects must be finished during the term. Finall grades will be based on overall participation and engagement with the material. Not finishing any one of the projects will result in an F. An A+ will be contingent on demonstrating exemplary growth in the duration of the course.

### Attendance

You will attend each of the 4 sessions. Exceptions may be made for funerals and / or meteor strikes

### Submitting Work

All assignment will be submitted on [Github](https://github.com)

### Missed Work

Under certain circumstances (computer caught on fire / chopped off fingers), extensions and make-up work will be allowed.

### Canceled Classes

If I need to cancel a class (chopped off fingers / computer caught on fire) I will notify the class via e-mail, canvas, and twitter.

### Universality, Inclusion, and Conduct

I am committed to teaching a class where all are welcome and included, with Universal design as a baseline. The highest standards of behavior are expected and required. If you have any concerns, needs, or want me to be aware of any particular requirements you may have, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Read Paul Ford's excellent expose [What is Code?](http://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-paul-ford-what-is-code/)

Create a website using github pages using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This web site needs at least 3 pages. The content should be something that you think is interesting. An explanation of the project will live in the repo's `README.md` file, and be written in Markdown.

##### Resources

- [HTML Element Reference.](http://htmlreference.io/)
- [CSS Reference.](http://cssreference.io/)
- [JavaScript Basics](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/JavaScript-basics)

##### Grad Students

This website needs to be at least 5 distinct pages, with full navigation from each page to each other page. There must be significant styling using CSS, at least one interactive element using JavaScript.

### 4/30 - How do they do that?

- Show off and briefly discuss student web sites
- Talk about what was hard, what was easy
- Explore some professional websites, taking a look under the hood.

#### For Next Session

Identify examples of world-class web design outside of the field of journalism. Identify examples of awful, truly terrible web design as well. Be prepared to discuss these examples, and how at least one of the disciplines of design is evident in your selections.

Create an [issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) on this repository with a link to the website, and a couple of paragraphs on why it is good or bad. Label your issue 'good' or 'bad'.

#### Grad Students

Provide 2 examples of each. Much more depth in analysis and critique is expected.
