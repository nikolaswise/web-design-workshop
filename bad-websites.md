# These Websites are Bad
http://pages.uoregon.edu/anthro/

In my work at the U of O, I’m often attempting to navigate through U of O department and program websites for info I need. I have found many of them lacking in design, overstuffed with info and hard to navigate. The U of O Anthropology program website follows these trend. 

As we discussed in class, when you arrive at a website you want to have a clear idea of a next step, this website just makes me want to leave because I’m overwhelmed. The moving info on the sidebar is distracting, and the lack of open space make it feel VERY cluttered. The information is NOT categorized in a way that is easy to navigate.
