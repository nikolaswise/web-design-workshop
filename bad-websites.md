# These Websites are Bad
# Stephanie Essin's Picks:
I hate to throw this website on the bad list...simply because I adore its creator so very much. His name is Arnold World. He spends his time at Powell's bookstore on Burnside making paper flower sculptures that are so realistic it's crazy. But the website for his product is lacking. 
http://worldpaperflowers.com/
This is a very poorly designed website in my opinion. There are too many icons and weird advertisements. The writing is choppy and confusing, and don't even bother navigating through it because you might end up reading about his 90 day plan for successful internet marketing (which he hasn't really achieved himself). I hate to be a hater, but this website made me a little nauseated.
