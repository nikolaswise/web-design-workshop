# These Websites are Bad

http://www.sarverwinery.com
I chose to compare two wine websites for this assignment. I don't like this website mostly because of horrible typography, but it is also very static. It has one image on the page framed by a text box, and seems to be very basic HTML. I don't like anything about this design; I find the text, images, page layout, color scheme, etc. to all be hideous. It doesn't seem like very much thought went into this site. - Courtney
