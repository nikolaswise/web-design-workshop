# These Websites are Bad

This site does not have the most compelling background or color design. I am not a fan of the typography. It took me about a whole minute to figure out what to click next. I actually skipped trying to figure out how the site works and moved on for a little while. When I finally did figure it out, I liked what came out. The LinkedIn link seemed like it would just take me to her LinkedIn Page so I avoided clicking it. Simplicity was a good thought, but if someone has to click around more to find the basic information from the landing page, I imagine they won't spend that much time on it.
